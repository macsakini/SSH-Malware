# SSH-Malware

A social-engineered attack against employees.  Simulated SSHd attack using Paramiko.

Copy the following command to your terminal

```sh
sh run sh

```
## The Project

The project is divided into three main parts. 
### 1. The main package file running from main.py .

This file simply initiates the two threads of the software. It initiates the first thread which is the game and the second which is the malware but joins them to a single instance. Here is the entry point to the software and the entire package runs from this particular file.

### 2. The game (innocous software)

The game is a simple atari game built using pygame. It uses a number of sprites from open source libraries to create a simple elegant game to keep the taret distracted while the daemon forms out to create its own process.

### 3. The malware (the daemonized package)

The malware is a simple ransomware utilizing paramiko and sftp to send all files in a specified folder to a target server. The files are then scrambled using a key that is sent to the server before being scrambled itself using the Fernet package.
